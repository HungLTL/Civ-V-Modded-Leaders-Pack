Though born in the rugged terrains of Mongolia, Kublai set his eyes on the sophisticated culture and untapped potentials of China, eventually establishing his rule there. Kublai Khan's early years were marked by military expeditions and a thirst for consolidation, stretching the borders of an already expansive empire."}
