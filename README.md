# DrTryhard/HungLTL's Civ V Modded Leaders Pack for Unciv
My first attempt at creating mods for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv), an open-source turn-based 4X game based on Civilization V by Firaxis. This is basically just a pack of Civilization mods that I use in my Civ V games, selected solely based on the fact that they have 3D leaderscenes, ported to Unciv.

This mod adds the following Civilizations:
### Canada, led by Wilfrid Laurier

* **Tim Hortons**: Unique Windmill replacement. Can be constructed on Hills, and while it retains the Windmill's production bonus towards buildings, it has a Merchant specialist slot instead of an Engineer and provides +1 Food for every 4 citizens in the city where it is built instead of the usual +2 Production bonus.

* **Khevsur**: Unique Classical Era Sword unit, replacing the Swordsman. Unlike the standard unit, the Khevsur moves faster and fights more effectively on Hills, whether it be on the offense or defense. Additionally, it does not require Iron unlike the Swordsman, and kills performed by a Khevsur contribute progress towards a Golden Age based on the Strength of the slain unit.

More importantly, each Treasury generates additional Happiness depending on the amount of reserved liquid Gold you have.

Additionally, if entering either the Medieval, Industrial or Atomic eras, gain a free Social Policy.

* **Lansquenet**: Unique Medieval Era Sword unit, replacing the Pikeman. Cheaper than the standard unit, the Lansquenet is cheaper to produce, and starts with both Formation promotions, making them a very effective anti-cavalry unit that can be mass produced. Additionally, this front-line unit obsoletes at Rifling and upgrades to a Rifleman, instead of a Lancer.
* **Rathaus**: Unique Water Mill replacement. Unlike the Water Mill, this building is more expensive to buy or build, and does not grant any food bonuses.
